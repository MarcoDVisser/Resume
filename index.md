`Feb'11 - present`{.label .label-success} 
:   *PhD student*, **Bioinformatics**, [MPI For Plant Breeding Research](http://www.mpipz.mpg.de/13072/jimenez), MPIPZ (Cologne, Germany).\
    I will be defending this year.

        Thesis: "Development and application of a computational pipeline to detect differen-tial splicing events from RNA-seq data."

`Oct'07 - Dec'09`{.label .label-success} 
:   *M.Sc*, **Bioinformatics**, [Zentrum fuer Bioinformatik](http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-science/departments/interdepartmental-centres/centre-for-bioinformatics-tuebingen/home.html), University of Tuebingen (Germany) 

        Thesis: "Kernel methods for Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)."

`2001 - 2005`{.label .label-success} 
:   *B. Tech*, **Electronics Engineering**, Anna University (Tamilnadu, India) \

## Experience {#experience}

`Bioinformatics`{.label .label-success} 
:   **Main PhD project:** 

    @. Developed a computational pipeline to **detect and statistically validate** differential splicing events between two or more RNA-seq datasets.\

    **Collaborative projects:** 

    @. Analysis of **large RNA-seq data** and **statistical testing** of the effect of RPS4 mediated immune response on alternative splicing patterns in Arabidopsis *thaliana*.
       (Manuscript to be submitted shortly.)
    @. Transcriptional profiling of *smg 7-1 pad 4-1* double mutant and *pad 4-1* single mutant in Arabidopsis *thaliana* to identify primary targets of NMD that are essential for immune response (Manuscript in review, TBA). \
    @. Differences in the distribution of alternative splicing events and potential impact of these splicing differences between dry and developing seeds in Arabidopsis *thaliana* (Manuscript in preparation).\
    
    **Outcome:** 
    
        - Experience in managing and efficiently handling analysis of very large data sets.
        - Develop user-friendly tools for reproducuible analysis through code reuse.
        - Designing appropriate statistical tests to test hypotheses, carefully.
        - Communicating clearly, appreciating better ideas, and working in harmony.

    I'm fortunate to have worked on these projects, because all of them together cover not *just* Bioinformatics but also Computational biology, Computer science and (Bio)statistics. 
    
`Other efforts`{.label .label-success} 
:   **data.table** is an R package designed to handle analysis of large (ex: NGS) data very efficiently, for faster development. I've been involved in the development since mid 2013.

    **Outcome:** 
    
        - Experience in the process of software release and maintenance.
        - Importance of unit testing towards software development productivity.
        - Communicating with other developers over long distances clearly.
        - Exhaustive documentation, helping users with issues, prioritise bug fixes.
        - Constant learning and improving, being aware and staying ahead of competition.

## Technical {#technical}

`R, C/C++, Perl`{.label .label-success} 
:   Co-developer and contributor of [R's data.table package](https://github.com/Rdatatable/datatable). \
    Authored various *in-house* R-packages such as `readCounts`, `gffutils`, `splicer` to facilitate analysis of Next Generation Sequencing (**NGS**) data through **reusable code**. \
    Developed various scripts and programs for automating pipelines for data preprocessing, filtering, analysis and visualisation using `R` and `Perl`.\
    Worked on various part-time jobs during M.Sc coding in `C` and `C++`.

`Project Management`{.label .label-success} 
:   Worked on [**three** different **collaborative** Bioinformatics projects](#experience) during my PhD, amongst various *other smaller side projects*. 
    
        Defined objectives for projects; discussion, organisation and completion of tasks; 
        communication of results to collaborators (mostly Geneticists / Plant biologists).

`Reproducibility`{.label .label-success} 
:   Git, Markdown, RMarkdown, Knitr, Pandoc, Bootstrap, Jekyll (workflow for reproducible analysis).

`Other`{.label .label-success} 
:   Bioconductor, HTML, CSS, Javascript, d3.js, Bash, Makefile, Matlab, Latex, Adobe Illustrator, Microsoft Office, iWorks, Openoffice.


`OS`{.label .label-success} 
:   My daily operating system is Mac OS X. But I'm equally adept with Linux and Windows.
