# Resume

This Resume was created in [Pandoc's Markdown](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/demo/example9/pandocs-markdown.html) and converted to html using `Pandoc`. And it was converted to `pdf` using `wkhtmltopdf`.

```bash
# installation for mac
brew install wkhtmltopdf

# installation for Debian/Ubuntu
apt-get install wkhtmltopdf
```
Check [this page](https://github.com/pdfkit/pdfkit/wiki/Installing-WKHTMLTOPDF) for more info.

I like this setup very much, as it's really flexible. Checkout the `Makefile`, which was borrowed from [this awesome blog](http://blog.chmd.fr/editing-a-cv-in-markdown-with-pandoc.html), with which we could convert it to `.docx` and `.txt` formats as well.
